# Sequence to sequence learning for generative context-aware query suggestion

<p align="justify">
If a search engine can understand users' intent and assist them by suggesting queries that are effective in formulating the users' information need, then the search engine can achieve better ranking 
performance on the submitted queries by the users to imporve overall search effectiveness. In this project, we aim to use sequence-to-sequence learning algorithm to make search engines capable of giving
context-aware query suggestions to their users.
